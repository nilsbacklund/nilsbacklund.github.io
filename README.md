# Nils Backlund

MSc Complex Adaptive Systems @ Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg.

I like building AI systems that do things in the real world and exploring approach that best fits the problem. Right now I'm training hybrid physics+neural network models in PyTorch to predict thermal behavior in semiconductor manufacturing (master's thesis at ASML). Before that I taught LLMs to hack honeypots for cybersecurity research at AI Sweden, and worked on autonomous systems at Andon Labs in San Francisco.

My background is in engineering physics. I've worked with time series forecasting, LLM agents, and classical ML, and I care more about picking the right tool than defaulting to the newest one. I've studied deep learning in Singapore (NTU) and applied AI in the Netherlands (TU Delft).

Currently looking for AI/ML roles starting September 2026.

### Featured project

**[Project Violet](https://github.com/nilsbacklund/project-violet)** - An LLM-on-LLM cybersecurity framework. AI attackers probe AI-defended honeypots to generate MITRE ATT&CK labeled datasets. Built with Python, Docker, and LLM APIs. 520+ commits.
